## Global Biodiversity Scenarios for the Year 2100 by O. E. Sala, et al (2000).

## Article Summary:
The author starts off by stating that global biodiversity, including terrestrial and freshwater organisms, is changing rather fast due to the human activities. Based on environmental changes, land use, and sensitivity of biodiversity, the author successfully develops three scenarios of biodiversity change by identifying five essential drivers, calculating the expected change of the drivers, and estimating the impact that each driver has on biodiversity. Then the author separately presents the expected changes in the five drivers and how they are going to affect different biomes. The author talks about the impact that each driver has on biodiversity in further details as well, stating that land-use change is the most influential one in general, followed by climate change. Furthermore, Sala states that biomes respond differently to each driver, for instance, a driver that can lead to maximum effect on one biome, can probably merely cause minor effect on the other ones. 

For the latter half of the article, the author summarizes the variation across biomes in response to changes in the drivers. Then the author provides three scenarios of biodiversity based on the assumption of no interactions, antagonistic interactions, or synergistic interactions among the drivers. The author states that grasslands and Mediterranean ecosystems will be damaged the most because of their sensitivity. Towards the end of the paper, the author discusses the uncertainties in the analysis, which include the interaction among drivers and magnitude of changes in drivers. At last, the author appeals the effort of scientists and policy makers to improve the future.

## Things I liked about the paper

There are two things that I liked about this paper. The first one is that the author provides a lot of examples across the entire paper. It makes the paper much easier to read for people who are not familiar with this topic. More importantly, these examples also make this paper much more convincing even though there are some flaws within the analysis. For instance, in the Drivers of Change section, the author gives an example on why land-use change is the most severe driver of changes in biodiversity. The author states that conversion of grasslands into croplands can lead to extirpation of most plant and animal species. Although the sentence is short, it is rather useful in clarifying authorâ€™s point. The other thing that I liked about this paper is that towards the end, the author actually appeals the efforts of people who have the power to prevent more species from going extinct. I found it really intriguing. 

## Things I did not like about the paper

One thing I did not like about the paper is that when the author was analyzing the data, the author did not give weighting to the size of the biomes nor the initial species diversity. I feel like these two aspects are rather important in analyzing the data. For instance, if we assume two biomes have the same species diversity, and one is way bigger than the other. Under the same circumstance that two species have gone extinct, the change in the biome that is bigger in size should be more catastrophic than the change in the smaller biome. However if we disregard the area size, the change in these two biomes would be the same in this case. As a result, I believe that taking area size and initial species diversity into account is necessary.

> A very nice observation that dovetails well with what we discussed in class.

## Evaluations of the figures and tables

I think the overall quality of the figures and tables is great. Table 1 and 2 give readers a rather explicit view of what the author says regarding the expected changes in the five drivers and impact each driver has on biodiversity. The author also provides several rather self-explanatory figures throughout the paper. I think they are rather easy to understand and quite useful in helping readers to follow the thoughts of the author. 

> I'm glad you liked them, but a more in depth description of the tables and figures would be appropriate.
