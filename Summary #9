Decoupling of taxonomic and ecologic severity of Phanerozoic marine mass extinction by M. L. Droser et al. (2016)

## Article Summary

The authors start off by stating that paleoecological system changes can be categorized into four levels. The first level is appearance or disappearance of an ecosystem, the second level is structural changes within an ecosystem, the third level is community level changes within an ecological structure, and the fourth level is community-level changes. All levels of changes have their own distinct signal(s). By utilizing this system, the authors analyze the paleoecological effects of two similar events, the Late Ordovician and the Late Devonian marine mass extinctions. The late Ordovician extinction is the second-largest extinction event, however this event had rather limited effect on reef, pelagic, and benthic settings despite the severity. Thus the authors state that most of the taxonomic losses only appeared in third and fourth-level changes in Late Ordovician. In contrast to Late Ordovicain extinction, the Late Devonian extinction also appeared in the second-level changes, indicating that Late Devonian extinction has more prolonged impact on ecosystem structure.

In the latter half of the article, the authors talk about how the ecological impact can be viewed by utilizing the factor analytic study. This study shows that the Late Ordovician mass extinction had no major effect on ecology, whereas the Late Devonian mass extinction caused a severe and lasting effect. The authors discuss that the reason these two similar mass extinctions caused different ecological impact is that some taxa are more important than others. Stromatoporoids, essential make-up of many reefal niches, is one of the examples. Furthermore, the authors state dominant taxa are recognized as more ecological valuable in modern ecology due to their high biomass. In the end, the authors summarize that some taxa are ecologically more significant than others, thus removal of these taxa may causes a significant effect on ecological structure. As a result, in protecting modern ecosystems, people should put more efforts on preservation of taxa with higher ecological value.

## Things I liked about the paper

There are two things I liked about the article. First of all, the authors offer a lot of examples to the readers throughout the entire paper. I think it is rather useful for me to understand the context of the paper. For example, in the first paragraph of the introduction section, the authors state that changes at the fourth level involve the appearance and disappearance of paleocommunities such as a succession of similar brachiopod-dominated communities. I think this example fully clarifies the definition of the fourth-level changes, and allows readers to better understand this article. Secondly, from my perspective, the way this paper was written is great. The authors not only kept the structure of the paper easy for readers to understand but also tended to reinforce the gist of the paper over and over again. I think it is rather helpful for readers to follow the authorsâ€™ train of thoughts when reading the paper. 

## Things I did not like about the paper

There is one thing I did not like about the paper. In the Late Ordovician Extinction section, I think the authors overly discuss the minor ecological changes in reef, pelagic and benthic settings. For example, the authors firstly talk about how graptolites underwent taxonomic loss in Late Ordovician, and recovered in Silurian. Then they state the same thing to nautiloid cephalopods and conodonts. I feel like this part is a little bit redundant, since one or two examples should be convincing enough for readers.

## Evaluations of figures and tables

I really enjoyed the overall quality of the table and figure in this article. Table 1 summarizes the definition and signals of each paleoecological level. I think it is rather handy for people who want to use this as a reference. Moreover, it is a great summary of what the authors state in the article. For figure 1, the legend gives us a rather explicit instruction on how to read the figure. In addition, the context gives a really nice interpretation of the figure.
