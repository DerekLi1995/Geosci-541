Problem Set 1:
Problem 1:
Max_ma columns of DataPBDB represent records whose temporal locality is at most this age.
Min_ma columns of DataPBDB represent records whose temporal locality is at least this age.

Problem 2:
> Oldestage<-tapply(DataPBDB[,"max_ma"],DataPBDB[,"genus"],max)

Problem 3:
> Yongestage<-tapply(DataPBDB[,"min_ma"],DataPBDB[,"genus"],min)

Problem 4:
>occurrences<-table(DataPBDB[,"genus"])
> max(occurrences)
[1] 1916
That is genus Anadara

Problem 5:
> Oldestage["Anadara"]
Anadara 
     66 
> Yongestage["Anadara"]
Anadara 
      0 

0-66 million years is the stratigraphic range of this taxon.

Problem set 2:
Question 1:
Randomly resample the occurrences of Lucia, and find the mean longitude of our random sample.
Lucina[,”paleolng”]: Longtitude of occurrences of Lucia;
Length(Lucina[,”paleolng”]): set the length to only the longitude of occurrences of Lucia
replace=true: sampling is with replacement
sample(): randomly sample the longitude of occurrences of Lucia
Mean: calculate the mean of the randomly sampled longitude of occurrences of Lucia

Question 2:
> plot(density(ResampledMeans))
It looks approximately like Gaussian distribution. Because it is higher in the middle, lower on the sides. However there is a dent at the top of the curve before it reaches the peak of density.

Question 3:
> mean(ResampledMeans)
[1] 24.16227
Yes, it is similar to the mean of the original data which is 24.1997.

Question 4:
> sort(ResampledMeans)

Question 5:
> Sorted<-sort(ResampledMeans)
> quantile(Sorted,c(0.025,0.975))
    2.5%    97.5% 
21.82094 26.28630 

Question 6:
Because it is approximately a Gaussian curve, so that the area between the 2.5th and 97.5 percentile is 95%, which is exactly the same as 95% confidence interval

Problem set 3:
Question 1:
I think it is still alive, because -1.221208 indicates that the genus is still alive 1.221208 million years in the future from today

Question 2:
> Dallarca<-subset(DataPBDB,DataPBDB[,"genus"]=="Dallarca")
> estimateExtinction(Dallarca[,"min_ma"],0.95)
Earliest   Latest 
 2.58800 -3.88749 

Question 3:
> 3.88749-2.58800
[1] 1.29949
Since 1.29949 is bigger than 0, indicating that the Dallarca is alive today, and it will still be 1.29949 million years in the future.

Question 4:
We should trust the pure reading of the fossil record, Dallarca is not alive today.

Problem set 4:
Question 1:
The fossils cannot be randomly distributed, because ecological condition such as weather can influence the preservation of fossils

Question 2:
Due to geological movement such as subduction, it is highly likely that the preservation changes up or down a stratigraphic section.

Problem set 5:
Question 1:
> nrow(DataPBDB)
[1] 67618
> nrow(ExtantData)
[1] 59097
> 67618-59097
[1] 8521
#8521 occurrences were lost by limiting our analysis to on extant bivalves.

Question 2:
> PresencePBDB<-presenceMatrix(DataPBDB,SampleDefinition="early_interval")
> ncol(PresencePBDB)
[1] 1018

[1] 1018

[1] 532
> length(unique(ExtantData[,"genus"]))
[1] 532

> 532/1018
[1] 0.5225933

#52.259% of Cenozoic bivalves in the PBDB are still extant today.

Question 3:
> Oldest<-tapply(ExtantData[,"max_ma"],ExtantData[,"genus"],max)

Question 4:
