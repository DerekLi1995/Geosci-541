The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction by J. L. Payne and S. Finnegan (2007)

> 10/10

## Article Summary
The authors start off by stating that although geographic range is perhaps the most popular determinant of extinction risk, it has only been evaluated for couple higher taxa. As a result, in this paper the authors use benthic marine invertebrate fossil to test if geographic range is strongly associated with extinction risk. It turns out that the answer is positive and surprisingly Payne and Finnegan also find that geographic range selectivity is weakest when in association with mass extinction. The approaches they use include utilizing logistic regression to evaluate the association between geographic range and extinction rate and to estimate the effect of geographic range on survivorship in the fossil record. The authors conclude that geographic range is closely associated with extinction risk. In addition, the authors state that the incompleteness of the fossil record will not affect the result since they examine the extinction risks in conjugation with different range size within each interval. Then Payne and Finnegan discuss that there are not only differences in sampling intensity between time bins, but also regional variability in sampling intensity. However, this finding could lead to bias since selectivity is evaluated independently.
	
In the latter half of the article, the authors discuss that the significant association between geographic range and survivorship, derived by assuming extinction risk is the same for all genera, indicates that geographic range is an essential indicator of extinction risk in marine animals, and there is a inverse correlation between selectivity and extinction intensity, resulting from the higher sensitivity of extinction risk. However, the authors state that some extinction events deviated from expected selectivity significantly, for example, the Late Ordovician extinction. The authors believe that it is caused by environmental disturbances occurred during these events. Early Triassic major extinction is a great example for this. Near the end of the article, the authors bring up another hypothesis that in the absence of evidence for disturbances during background extinctions, most of them could result form geographically limited processes.

## Things I liked about the paper
There are several things I liked about this paper. First of all, I liked the way this paper is structured. The authors sort of combined the results and methods section by integrating methods within the results section. From my perspective, it makes the entire article more smooth and integrative. Because of this, I was able to better follow the flow of the article and understand the points that the authors are trying to convey. A great example will be the beginning of the fourth paragraph of the results section. The authors state that in order to evaluate the impact of heterogeneous sampling on apparent geographic range selectivity, they compare observed odd ratios to changes in five metrics of record quality. This part successfully conveys the gist of this paragraph and shows the readers what kind of approach the author used.

The second thing I liked about this paper is that the authors state what can potentially affect the results of this study in order to prove that although genera in well sampled intervals will clearly tend to exhibit larger absolute ranges than genera in poorly sampled intervals, the result will not be affected. I think it is a rather efficient and persuasive way to clear up any confusion or doubt. At least, I was convinced by the authors when I was reading this part. 

## Things I did not like about the paper
There was one thing I did not like about the paper. The last few parts of this article confused me quite a lot. First of all, I feel like these information are not really necessary to give in the article. Moreover, the way that the authors structured these paragraphs makes them really hard to understand, since they are kind of independent of the entire paper. It gives me a really hard time relating these paragraphs to the information I gained previously from the article. For instance, in the metrics of record quality section, the authors mention three metrics of record quality. At first, I was rather unsure about what these three things are, so I have to go back to the article and find where the authors talk about them and review these concepts. I think it would be much clearer and helpful for readers if the authors integrate these independent paragraphs into the associated parts of the article. 

## Evaluations of figures and tables
I really enjoyed the overall quality of the tables and figures in this article. All the figures and tables explicitly tell us what the authors are trying to convey in the article. For instance, table one clearly shows us the correlations between geographic range selectivity and change in metrics of record quality. Not only it is rather closely related to the content, the legend also provides a lot of information, assisting readers to interpret the data. The only thing that needs a bit improvement is figure three. It is kind of overcrowded for us to read.
