How good was the fossil record? Clues from the Californian Pleistocene by J.W. Valentine (1989)

## Article Summary
The author starts by stating the difficulties of inferring past biological processes from fossil record<strike>s</strike>, however despite the difficulties, the relevant research has been rather successful. Then the author focuses readers’ attention on the marine benthic communities, on which three major sorts of studies are commonly conducted. The first kind is the study of the modern fauna. The problem with this study is that the fossil assemblages are usually more diverse than the actual living fauna. The second sort of study focuses on the interpretation of fossil assemblages. The problem with this kind of study is that it is hard to learn which species are more prone to fossilization, so that it is hard to infer the entire community. The third one involves quantitative assessments of the stratigraphic records. Then the author states the gist of this paper, which is evaluation of the completeness of fauna’s fossilization in Californian Province. 

The author decides to compare two fauna, the living fauna and the Pleistocene fauna. The author spends a lot of effort in establishing the list of which species should be included in this analysis in order to achieve consistency in morphospecies comparison between two selected fauna. In the latter half of the article, the author talks about the reasons why some of the species are included or excluded and how the presence of “extralimital” species can be utilized to infer the marine temperature at a certain time period. Furthermore, the author summarizes that accumulation of dead shells are enough to form a complete record of the easily fossilized species of the living fauna, and those are not found in the fossil pool are categorized as fragile and rare. Towards the end of the paper, the author talks about the limitation of this paper, which is some of the species have not yet to be found. At last, the author gives a discussion about the implications of this paper, stating that the amount of fossilized sediment decreases through time as a result of he tectonic movement or erosion. Furthermore, the loss of fossils is not caused by the incorporation processes but by the destruction of the fossil record itself.

## Things I liked about this paper
There are two things I liked about this paper. The first thing is that the author talks about the implications of his discoveries throughout the entire paper. For example, in the comparison of the living with the Pleistocene fauna section, Valentine discusses the presence of “extralimital” species in the Pleistocene deposits is usually taken as an indication that the marine environment in the Pleistocene is quite different from what we have today. This gives readers more information to ponder on even though it is not quite relevant to the gist of this paper. The second thing is that the author states the limitation of this paper towards the end of the paper. I think it is quite remarkable for Valentine to acknowledge the imperfection of his own work. 

## Things I did not like about this paper
There is one thing I did not like about this paper. I feel like the author spends too much effort explaining how he selected the species that he utilizes in the analysis. Even though this information is necessary, the author could have put more effort into the implication section, which is only like a page of the entire paper. By extending the implication section, the readers can gain a better understanding of the purpose of this study, as well as the knowledge that it is trying to convey.

## Evaluations of the figures and tables
I think the overall quality of the figure and table is great. Figure one is my favorite since it explicitly shows us the localities that the author mentions in the paper. I always think that a great table/figure is worth a thousand words. In addition, table one also gives readers a great overview of the living molluscan species.
