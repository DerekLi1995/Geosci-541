Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity by Bambach et al. (2004)

## Article Summary
The Authors start off by stating that there were five mass extinctions that have been identified. While Raup and Sepkoski think that the mass extinction can be plotted against background extinction, Quinn proposes otherwise. Quinn thinks that the distribution of extinction rates does not have outliers. Then the authors bring up Wangâ€™s research in order to express that continuity of magnitude is an important concept when investigating whether mass extinction grade into background extinction. Because of the importance, the authors reevaluate the continuity of magnitude and test whether any five major extinctions are differentiable from the distribution of other extinction intensities. One of the main points that the authors make in this article is that diversity is a function of origination and extinction. By looking at diversities at interval boundaries, it is possible to tell if origination and extinction are in balance or not. Another main point that the authors address is that these five intervals are better regarded as mass depletions of diversity. Among them, only three are statistically distinct mass extinctions.  The authors also state that, if the extinction intensity curve were unimodel, background and mass extinctions are continuous in magnitude, however if it were bimodal, the background and mass extinctions are discontinuous. Another main problem tackled by the authors is that why even though the Cambrian and Early Ordovician had rather low diversity, they still had really high turnover rate? The answer is that these two biodiversity losses are primarily due to low level of genus origination. Furthermore, the authors state near the end of the article that the five major depletions of diversity are rather different. They each have their own cause and effect.

In conclusion, the authors summarize that two of the five mass depletions are mostly related to decrease in origination and rest of them result exclusively from elevated extinctions. Since the depletion magnitudes of the rest three intervals are significantly different than background extinction, they are the only ones that can be called as true mass extinctions.

## Things I liked about the paper
There are two things I liked about the paper. First of all, the authors utilize a lot of examples throughout the entire paper. I think they are rather useful for readers in terms of understanding the concepts and statements that authors make in the article. For instance, in the last paragraph of the tracking genus diversity section, in order to clarify how rapid origination could conceal the low diversity at the start of the interval, the authors explain that at the Silurian, the low point of diversity is masked in the total diversity curve, because the origination was rather high in the first interval of the Devonian. 

The other thing I liked about the paper is that although the summary is relatively short, it is rather comprehensive. It successfully summarizes most of the main points that the authors make in this article. I found it really impressive that the authors are able to condense the entire paper in just three paragraphs.

## Things I did not like about the paper
There are two things I did not like about the paper. This article is rather long and kind of tedious to read. I feel like if the authors could manage to shorten the length of the article, it will definitely become more intriguing and readable for readers. The other thing I did not like about the paper is that the authors divide this paper into too many sub-parts. I feel like this structure makes it a lot harder for readers to make connections between each part. I think this is also the reason that I think this paper is not quite readable compared to other papers we have read previously.

> This is more stylistic than scientific.

## Evaluations of figures and tables
I really enjoyed the overall quality of the tables and figures in this article. Each figure or table explicitly tells us what the authors are trying to convey in the article. For instance, the first figure is a great representation of the five major depletions in biodiversity. It shows us not only when they happened, but also their scale. In addition, the legends are also quite useful when interpreting figures and tables. Some of them even provide more information regarding the main ideas that the authors provide in this article.
